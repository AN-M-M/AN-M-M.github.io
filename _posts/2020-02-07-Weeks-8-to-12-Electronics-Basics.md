To get more comfortable with electronics, we decided to spend a couple of weeks deep diving into some foundations of electronics. Some of the topics we covered as a part of this included:

1. Soldering and desoldering test circuits
2. Testing with a multimeter
3. Circuit analysis
4. Circuit design printing - Laser PCB and CNC PCB


**Soldering and desoldering test circuits**

*Materials required for desoldering and soldering*

- Soldering iron

- Soldering paste (to keep the soldering iron clean)
